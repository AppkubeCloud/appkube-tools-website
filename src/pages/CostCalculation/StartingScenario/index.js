              In this scenario, a number of modules of a retail bankâ€™s
              credit-scoring application have been migrated to cloud, primarily:

            <ul>
              <li>web UI for back-office personnel</li>
              <li>workflow and business-logic applications</li>
              <li>advanced analytics scoring models</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Some of the core components and a substantial amount of customer
              data are still being hosted on-premises. For the purposes of this
              simulation, total annual cloud spend for the application is
              assumed to be roughly $1 million.
